Project: Unsupervised Learning and Email Spam Classification
K-Means Clustering with the Elbow Method
In this project, I explored the K-Means clustering algorithm to work with unsupervised data. K-Means helps in grouping data into distinct clusters, which can then be used to predict better outcomes for various applications. The key part of this project was determining the optimal number of clusters (K) when dealing with large datasets. To achieve this, I implemented the Elbow Method, which helped me visualize the "elbow" point and decide the ideal value of K for accurate clustering.

Email Spam Classification using Naive Bayes
For the second part of the project, I worked on email spam classification, where the goal was to predict whether an email is spam or not. To achieve this, I used the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm, which is highly effective for text classification tasks. It works by calculating the probability of an email being spam based on its features.
Since Naive Bayes works best with features that have continuous outcomes, I experimented with two versions of the algorithm:

Gaussian Naive Bayes: Best suited for small datasets and continuous features.
Multinomial Naive Bayes: More appropriate for counting the frequency of words.
After testing both methods, I found that Gaussian Naive Bayes performed better, especially in dealing with small datasets. Its ability to classify continuous features made it a more accurate choice for this email spam classification task.

Key Takeaways:
Learned the importance of K-Means clustering for better prediction outcomes.
Applied the Elbow Method to optimize the number of clusters.
Gained experience with Naive Bayes classifiers, including Gaussian and Multinomial, for text classification.
