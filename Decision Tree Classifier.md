Project: Decision Tree Classifier for Survival Rate Prediction

Decision Tree Classifier
In this project, I used the Decision Tree classifier to predict the survival rate based on various features. The task involved checking the accuracy of the model by evaluating which features were most influential in determining the survival rate. I leveraged feature importance to correlate features and trained the model using a correlation matrix, ensuring that the most relevant features were considered.

Troubleshooting and Code Optimization
While working on the project, I faced some errors in the code due to adjustments I made with the algorithms. Through troubleshooting and debugging, I learned how to fine-tune the model and resolve these issues effectively. The experience helped me understand how a Decision Tree algorithm checks and selects the best features for training the model by continuously evaluating which feature suits best.

Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for the model, I used the LabelEncoder from Scikit-learn to convert categorical features into numerical ones. Additionally, I employed the train-test split method to divide the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model was tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

Key Takeaways:
1. Gained hands-on experience with the Decision Tree classifier and feature importance.
2. Learned how to handle categorical data using LabelEncoder.
3. Used train-test split to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy.
4. Developed troubleshooting skills for code errors related to algorithm tuning.
