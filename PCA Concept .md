This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the Digits and Heart Disease datasets to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information and mitigating overfitting.
The Digits dataset contains 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9), where PCA helps retain key features while reducing noise. 
The Heart Disease dataset consists of medical records related to heart disease diagnosis, with PCA applied to analyze key contributing factors and improve classification models.
By reducing redundant features, PCA not only enhances model efficiency but also minimizes overfitting, leading to better generalization.
The project involves data preprocessing (scaling, normalization), visualization (scatter plots, explained variance graphs), and model training to compare performance before and after PCA.
Results indicate that PCA effectively reduces dataset complexity while maintaining classification accuracy, providing insights into feature importance and ensuring the model learns meaningful patterns. 
The repository includes scripts and notebooks for implementing PCA, along with installation instructions and project documentation.
