📌 Panic Attack Prediction Model
This project analyzes a panic attack dataset and applies Linear Regression from the scikit-learn library to predict outcomes and improve model accuracy. The focus is on enhancing predictive performance while reducing overfitting.

🔹 Techniques Used
Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
Feature Engineering to identify key contributing factors.
Regularization (L1 & L2) to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics such as R² score and MSE to assess model performance.
🔍 Key Insights
Linear Regression improves accuracy by identifying relationships between features.
Regularization techniques like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) can be explored to further optimize model performance.
🚀 Next Steps
Experiment with Polynomial Regression for non-linear patterns.
Implement Lasso & Ridge Regression to compare model performance.
Visualize feature importance to refine model selection.
